<div>Aggregated silver films are commonly used in SERS substrates, as sensors, and for enhancing optical absorption and emission processes; for example in solar cells or solid state lasers. In order to probe or drive systems containing silver aggregates, their optical characteristics must be thoroughly understood. However, the stochastic nature of chemical deposition methods results in sample-to-sample variance in microscopic morphology and consequently optical extinction line shapes. Previous authors have modeled the optical extinction of silver aggregates using Mie models; however, they either did not observe or did not report sample-to-sample variance. Here we consider distinct microscopic morphologies as the primary drivers of optical response. A simple extinction line shape criterion classifies samples into two categories which are both optically and morphologically distinct. We find that an extinction model with aggregates excluded reproduces the transition between extinction classifications and the widths of extinction peaks, but modeled spectra are blueshifted from the exact extinction peak locations. We hypothesize that plasmon coupling within particle aggregates is most likely responsible for skewing the aggregate-free model relative to the experimental extinction data. The numbers of particles per aggregate exhibit surface coverage-dependent trends, which suggests that the model-experiment discrepancy may be influenced by different aggregate types at different surface coverages.&nbsp;</div>
