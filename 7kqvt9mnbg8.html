<div>Any optical model of metal nanoparticles relies on information about particle morphology, such as particle size and shape. The extinction and scattering of monodisperse particle ensembles deposited from uniform colloids tends to be described well by the Mie theory, and regular lattices of particles arranged on substrates via focused ion beam milling or nanoimprint lithography can be described by their collective modes; however, the complex variations in shape and size of particles in chemically deposited systems stymie attempts at similar descriptions.<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Allen1974}</cite> While the extinction of specific particle aggregate configurations have been successfully simulated using Mie theory,<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Kreibig_1996,Quinten_1986}</cite> we lack a flexible model which can both explain the features of optical extinction spectra and yield physical insight into film morphology and thus aid in employing films in practical applications.</div>
