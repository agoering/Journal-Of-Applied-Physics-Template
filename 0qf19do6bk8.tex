Silver nanoparticle films with a range of surface coverages were grown using a modified Tollenâ€™s reaction.(Peterson 2007) Glass microscope slides were cleaned by soaking in a 1:3 ratio of hydrogen peroxide to sulfuric acid (piranha solution) for at least 30 minutes to remove organic contaminants. Substrates were then coated with a 20% (vol/vol) solution of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) in anisole, by spin coating at 3000rpm for 60 seconds and curing at $180^\circ$ C for 6 minutes. The PMMA solution was doped with Rhodamine 6G dye for the purposes of a separate experiment, but the presence of the dye is not important for the purposes of this paper. The dye produces weak extinction peak at 520nm which is accounted for in our analysis.
