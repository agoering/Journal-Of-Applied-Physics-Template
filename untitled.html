<h1 data-label="874460" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>Chemically deposited metal nanoparticle films have been employed in applications ranging from [gas and biological] sensing and catalysis to efficiency enhancements for solar cells and random lasers. Many of these applications take advantage of the unique electromagnetic excitations these films can support, whether they be the individual nanoparticles’ plasmon resonances or the plasmon localization stemming from multiple scattering in randomly located particles. Experimenters excite or detect such electromagnetic modes optically; thus, a strong understanding of films’ optical properties is critical to effectively harnessing the advantages offered by such modes.&nbsp;</div>
