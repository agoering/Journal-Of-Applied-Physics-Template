<div>Our chemical process produces characteristic length scales such as the fundamental metal grain size (monomer size), which is independent of metal filling fraction, and an island size described by radius of gyration which increases with filling fraction.<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Davis2012}</cite> These characteristic lengths are reproducible; however, the chemical deposition process is inherently stochastic: microscopic morphologies vary even for samples with the same metal filling fraction. As a result, the optical extinction of samples which we expect to be statistically similar can exhibit very different line shapes. Other authors have reported on the optical extinction of similar films,<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Yin2002}</cite> yet we have not seen other reports of line shape variation. We seek to understand why some samples with the same surface coverage exhibit different extinction line shapes, and how those line shapes arise from variations in microscopic morphology, including particle size, aggregate configuration, and island coalescence. We find that line shapes are primarily influenced by the Mie response of round particles in the sample, with broadening stemming from variance in the distribution of particle size and a redshift which may arise from coupling within particle aggregates or complex interactions with the substrate.</div><div></div><h1 data-label="848297" class="ltx_title_section">Methods</h1><h2 data-label="664465" class="ltx_title_subsection">Sample Fabrication</h2><div>Silver nanoparticle films with a range of surface coverages were grown using a modified Tollenâ€™s reaction.<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Peterson2007}</cite> Glass microscope slides were cleaned by soaking in a 1:3 ratio of hydrogen peroxide to sulfuric acid (piranha solution) for at least 30 minutes to remove organic contaminants. Substrates were then coated with a 20% (vol/vol) solution of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) in anisole, by spin coating at 3000rpm for 60 seconds and curing at $$$C for 6 minutes. The PMMA solution was doped with Rhodamine 6G dye for the purposes of a separate experiment, but the presence of the dye is not important for the purposes of this paper. The dye produces weak extinction peak at 520nm which is accounted for in our analysis.</div>
