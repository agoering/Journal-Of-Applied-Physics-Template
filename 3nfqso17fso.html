<div>Our chemical process produces characteristic length scales such as the fundamental metal grain size (monomer size), which is independent of metal filling fraction, and an island size described by radius of gyration which increases with filling fraction.<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Davis2012}</cite> These characteristic lengths are reproducible; however, the chemical deposition process is inherently stochastic: microscopic morphologies vary even for samples with the same metal filling fraction. As a result, the optical extinction of samples which we expect to be statistically similar can exhibit very different line shapes. Other authors have reported on the optical extinction of similar films,<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Yin2002}</cite> yet we have not seen other reports of line shape variation. We seek to understand why some samples with the same surface coverage exhibit different extinction line shapes, and how those line shapes arise from variations in microscopic morphology, including particle size, aggregate configuration, and island coalescence. We find that line shapes are primarily influenced by the Mie response of round particles in the sample, with broadening stemming from variance in the distribution of particle size and a redshift which may arise from coupling within particle aggregates or complex interactions with the substrate.</div><div></div><h1 data-label="848297" class="ltx_title_section">Methods</h1><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="915539" class="ltx_title_section">Results</h1><div></div>
